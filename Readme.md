# Hack any Axtel router

1) Run `./axtel-hack.sh`
2) Supply information.
3) Enjoy!

## How it works:

Axtel passwords are 8 alphanumeric characters which last 4 are always the last 4 of the SSID's (eg: AXTEL XTREMO-D43B).
Uses `airmon-ng`, `airodump-ng`, and `crunch`. Make sure you have them installed beforehand.
